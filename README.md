### API Endpoints
| HTTP Verbs | Endpoints | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/users/ | To sign up a new user account |
| GET | /api/users/_id | To login an existing user account |
| POST | /api/users/ | To create a new cause |
| PUT | /api/users/id | To retrieve all causes on the platform |
| DELETE | /api/users/id | To retrieve details of a single cause |
| GET | /api/team: | To edit the details of a single cause |
| GET | /api/team/:id | To delete a single cause |


This API endpoint is used to retrieve a list of users. It sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL: https://kamil-patel.onrender.com/api/users/.
The last execution of this request returned a response with a status code of 200, indicating a successful request. The response body contained an array of user objects, with each object having properties such as _id, id, first_name, last_name, email, gender, avatar, domain, available, and __v. 
Additionally, the response included information about the pagination of the user list, such as the current page number (currentPage), total number of pages (totalPages), and total number of users (totalUsers).
Please note that the actual values of the user properties are not provided in the response. You can use this endpoint to retrieve a list of users and their associated information.
To use this endpoint, send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL. No request parameters are required.

Example Response:
```json
Status: 200 OK
{
    "users": [
        {
            "_id": "",
            "id": 0,
            "first_name": "",
            "last_name": "",
